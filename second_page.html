    <h1>Q&A for some of your questions</h1>
    <p> These are a few topics of things people may want to know about exercising, especially in the middle of a global pandemic. Some of the common questions are listed below.</p>
    <p>   Getting outside should be a fun time, and the photo gallery shows a few different forms of activities people can do. Anything from riding your bike to walking your dog will count. </p>
    <p>  Creating new ways of exercise can be just as fun. Don't feel judged if you want to make something up. Have fun with it! Movement can help anyone feel more postive about their day.</p>
    <p> Questions and data from <a href= "https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/09/29/creative-ways-to-exercise-during-the-pandemic"> the American Heart Association</a> show some facts and questions relating to exercise. The information is broken up into segments below. </p>

    <h2> What is the difference between exercising and physical activity?</h2>
    <p> The first question from the <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults?gclid="> American Heart Association </a> talks more in-depth about these commonly asked questions. They suggest ways for people just starting exercise, and they encourage sitting less. </p>
    <p> Both are forms of movement that people should try to do. It is better to get both, but at least doing one of the two is desired.</p>
    <p>Exercise is planned physical activity that is divided into different categories. Two of these catergories are strength and cardio. The terms aerobic and anerobic are used within as well.</p>
    <p>Physical activity is any movement like walking or skipping rocks. It can be light, moderate, or intense. Any activity can be made to be harder or easier as well. There is no one right way.</p>

    <h2> What are the benefits of exercising?</h2>
    <p> Multiple studies list nunerous positive benefits. <a href= "https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults?gclid=Cj0KCQiA5bz-BRD-ARIsABjT4ng-_2P_O2ouf6F_hMZPAFB0s0D2A6lqNa90_PUgc-q3KXJqS0Lw5y4aAv_UEALw_wcB"> The American Heart Association </a> mentions more specifically. Some of the ways are that it can help control weight, reduce your risk of heart disease, maintain proper blood sugar levels, and it can help keep judgement healthy. It can be a combination of all of them.</p>
    <p>Exercising properly can help you sleep better, strengthen your bones, and it can improve mental health. It can keep people feeling sharper in the day.</p>
    <p>It might seem like a chore to do every day, but there are many other ways that a simple hour of exercise can help. It just takes a little planning to do.</p>


    <h2>How much exercise should an adult try to get? </h2>
      <p>According to <a href="https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/2015-2020-dietary-guidelines/guidelines/appendix-1/#:~:text=For%20substantial%20health%20benefits%2C%20adults,and%20vigorous%2Dintensity%20aerobic%20activity.">the Physical Activity Guideline for Americans</a> 150 minutes of moderate exericse, and two days of strength are wanted. If you get more, than that is great! Muscle strengthening is recommended as well. Taking breaks and using intervals are important.</p>
      <p> Don't try to get this time for the first few weeks. It is better to ease back into a routine. It is better to work slowly than go too fast. </p>
      <p> Getting back into shape does not happen immediately, and starting slow can help. Try to add 30 minutes or an hour every week to pace yourself! It can be a little motivational challenge within a family.</p>

    <h2>How much exercise should a child get? </h2>
      <p> Also by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/children/index.htm#:~:text=Children%20and%20adolescents%20ages%206,doing%20push%2Dups"> The CDC</a> suggests that children between age 6-17 should try to get at least 60 minutes of exericse per day. </p>
      <p> Children often begin learning their habits of exercising from the people they are with every day. They should be motivated and inspired to keep active habits. </p>
      <p> Kids under 6 need exercise still. Stretching and short walks are ideas for them. One idea is to ask your kids to show their favorite game from PE. It doesn't have to be much, but they should find ways to get their energy out. This is especially because they are most likely at home from school still. </p>

    <h2>Is it safe to excercise outside?</h2>
      <p> It might feel weird to be outside without a mask, but it is safe. Getting some outside space is dire to mental health. Maybe even just sitting outside and reading is something to get some fresh air. </p>
        <p> Bike riding or going on a walk with the family you live with is the best option. </p>
        <p> Try to maintain social distance between groups of people you don't live with to follow health regulations. </p>
        <p> Studies have said it is good to not wear your mask while exercising outdoors. <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters?gclid=Cj0KCQiA5bz-BRD-ARIsABjT4ngminktyU_6E026wL3ft2l33v7HNzfvzu1eoKfU5xOqs_A0K5Y9booaAn0EEALw_wcB#exercising"> The World Health Organization </a> says that masks can stop breathing as well. It is good to have time with and without a mask on for health reasons. If you do wear your mask, make sure you wash it. </p>

    <h2> Are playgrounds and swings safe for children?</h2>
    <p> The risks are ranked by low, moderate, and high.  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/parks-rec/park-administrators.html"> The CDC </a> recommended that playgrounds and other gym equipment aren't used as much. People touch these surfaces, and it is hard to keep them clean often. If you do use them, bring sanitizers to wash your hands.</p>
    <p> If children are going to use them, they need to make sure they don't touch their eyes or face after getting off the equipment. It is important to wash hands as soon as possible. </p>

    <h2> How can I be active without physically going to the gym?</h2>
    <p> This is the perfect time to be creative. Some gyms and community centers have started to move their classes to be on live streams. Exercising from home can be just as effective as a studio.</p>
    <p> Colleges and universities have rec centers that are live streaming as well. Mizzou has free virtual classes this year for all interested students and faculty. Students have to sign up prior to the class, but they can be taken from anywhere. </p>
    <p> If you don't have weights, that is okay! Some options for weights are to use laundry detergent bottles or sand bags. These can help create extra resistance.</p>
    <p> Walking or exercising in a group safely can be fun. <a href="https://mizzourec.com/programs/fitness/tigerx/"> Tiger X </a> has been revamping their classes to be safe with COVID-19 procedures this year. The only classes in-person this year are reformer pilates and cycling. All the machines are being cleaned by staff every 30 minutes. </p>

    <h2> I am currently injured. What are some good exercises I can do to stay moving?</h2>
    <p> Monitor your injuries first before doing anything. You don't want to make any potential injuries worse before you know what happened.</p>
      <p>If you are injured, try to avoid HIIT classes. These are naturally high intensity intervals. For a different way, try to walk slowly for as long as you can. If you have access to water, you can try that.</p>
      <p> People with feet and knee problems tend to like swimming. It is lighter on the joints, and it can be an alternative to get a full-body workout. Swimming is great if you aren't injured, too! </p>
      <p> If you are injured and can't walk, you can lift light hand weights while staying in a stationary position. Sometimes it is hard to sit and not move all day. This can be a way to not further any damage, and you are still moving. </p>
