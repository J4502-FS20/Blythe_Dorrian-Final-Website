    <h1>Don't know where to start?</h1>
    <p> These are few different types of activities people can do outside or inside It might depend on space and equipment you have, but there are variations for everyone.</p>
    <p> This is not an exhaustive list of things to do. Other things would be to make a weights station at home. Gallons of water, laundry detergent, and other heavy household items work.</p>
    <p> In terms of exercise videos, MadFit is one of my favorites.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkVHrA5o23o"></a> She does dance fitness, cardio without jumping, and other apartment friendly exercises.</p>

        <img src="walking.jpg" alt="Walk dog" onclick="myFunction(this);">
      </div>
      <p> Walking a dog can be a harder exercise than it looks. It is good for you and your furry friend. I know my dogs often times walk me. </p>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="soccer.jpg" alt="Play game" onclick="myFunction(this);">
      </div>
      <p> Soccer is a very intense exercise to do. The players often get very into the game. It can be a simple game. Kicking the ball is a good test of agility and coordination. </p>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="catcher.jpg" alt="Baseball position" onclick="myFunction(this);">
      </div>
      <p> Baseball is an exercise most people can do. Sometimes it is fun to set up fake bases and run around them. </p>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="run.jpg" alt="Walk but faster" onclick="myFunction(this);">
      </div>
      <p> Running is a something that I have noticed more people do. It doesn't require any machines or equipment. People can speed walk, trot, or jog. There is nothing stopping them.</p>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="bike.jpg" alt="Evening ride" onclick="myFunction(this);">
      </div>
      <p> Bike sales have increased since the pandemic started in March. Kids have finally been learning how to ride them, and more families have been craving getting back on the trails. </p>
        <img src="football.jpg" alt="Game" onclick="myFunction(this);">
      </div>
      <p> Football can seem scary. However, it is a fun game to play as a pick up with a group of friends. When I was younger, my dad tried to teach me how to throw a football. It can be a good skill to learn.</p>
        <img src="swim.jpg" alt="Exercise indoors" onclick="myFunction(this);">
      </div>
      <p> Pool access is sometimes an issue, but it is one of the best forms of exercise to do if you can get to one. As a competitive swimmer myself, I have foot/knee problems. Though I can't run, I can swim. I try to go at least two to three times a week.</p>
        <img src="fishing.jpg" alt="Relaxing exercise" onclick="myFunction(this);">
      </div>
      <p> Fishing is a calming way to get outside. Sometimes if an easy activity is desired, just casting a line around can help. It is more fun on a cool day when the fish are actually biting.</p>
        <img src="splash.jpg" alt="Cool off" onclick="myFunction(this);">
      </div>
      <p> Hanging around with friends at a safe distance is important. Playing outside with a hose or water balloon/water gun is a fun way to get some running in. This can be adapted to make sure social distancing is still being folllowed.</p>
      <img src="horse.jpg" alt="Alternative racing" onclick="myFunction(this);">
    </div>
    <p> Horseback riding or running around with an animal can be a fun activity. Volunteering at a farm can be a good idea. Horses are very therapeutic. There are several horse ranches out in Columbia. For example, Cedar Creek is always looking for people.</p>
