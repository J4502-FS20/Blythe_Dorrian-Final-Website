    <h1>Trends around the US </h1>
    <p> Exercise levels have been a studied topic for years even before the pandemic began earlier this year. This worldwide spread has been continued since everything has been closing.</p>
    <p> The WHO noted that smartphone apps that track steps and heart rate have dropped 50% since March 2020. A study published on June 29 said that 19,144,639 measurements have still been taken from 187 countries. </p>
    <p> According to the CDC, 23% of Americans get the required amount of exercise per week. Children spend more than seven hours in front of a screen.</p>
    <p> In the Midwest, the trends are slightly higher. Missouri has a 23.6% average, Kansas has a 23.2%. This is still slightly above average.</p>
