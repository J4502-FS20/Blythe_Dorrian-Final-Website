    <h1>Trends around the US </h1>
    <p> Exercise levels have been a studied topic for years even before the pandemic began earlier this year. This worldwide spread has been continued since everything has been closing.</p>
    <p> Studies have been tracked around the US and the world. <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/07/417951/physical-activity-dropped-worldwide-during-covid-19-raising-concerns-health"> The University of California- San Fransisco </a> noted that smartphone apps that track steps and heart rate have dropped 50% since March 2020. A study published on June 29 said that 19,144,639 measurements have still been taken from 187 countries. </p>
    <p> Diminishing levels have been observed as well. <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#:~:text=Less%20than%205%25%20of%20adults,of%20physical%20activity%20each%20week.&text=Only%2035%20%E2%80%93%2044%25%20of%20adults,65%2D74%20are%20physically%20active"> the Department of Health and Human Services </a> said that less than 5% of Americans get the required amount of 30 minutes of exercise per day. More than 80% of adults don't get the required muscle strengthening activity.</p>
    <p> It was noted from the same study that back in March, outdoor levels of exercise started to slowly increase. New data is being tracked to see how changes are happening. </p>


      <img src="map.jpg" alt="country"/>
      <p> The map above from the <a href= "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr112.pdf"> National Health Interview Survey in 2010-2015 </a> describes the state's average of exercise. The national average is 22.9%. </p>
      <p> In the Midwest, the trends are slightly higher. Missouri has a 23.6% average, Kansas has a 23.2%. This is still slightly above average. </p>
        <p>The states in red are significantly lower than average. Light pink means they are below average, but it is not a significant amount. Light blue means they are greater than average, but not significantly. Lastly, dark blue means they are significantly above average.</p>
      <p> The south has some of the lower rates of exercise compared to the rest of the country, while the west coast typically has higher rates. However, there is a mix of rates throughout the country. </P>
        <p> The states are listed below in alphabetical order. Try to find the state where you are from. </p>
